# Utilities

## convert

Convert XML <=> JSON.

Initial purpose is to get json where there
is currently on xml available.

Additionally, we can proofread the existing
json by comparing it to newly converted.
(Use "diff" software rather than hand-checking.)

## Other Ideas

### Filter

Able to reduce the xml/json to a subset
based on region, bands, modes, etc.
